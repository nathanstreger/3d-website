        <h2>üìú About Me</h2>
        <h3><a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jrS_rBqY7g-M_ju_3WOwpD1r2SpGQqp6/view?usp=sharing" type="application/pdf">Resume</a></h3>
        <p>
          <b>Professional: </b>I have been a software developer at Reynolds and Reynolds in College Station for almost 2 years now. Before that, I worked as a middle school teacher at Knox Junior High School in the Woodlands. I loved teaching very much, but the desire to provide a little more for my family and my love of complex problems drove me towards the realm of programming. I have gained many skills since then, and continue to learn other skills outside of the work I do for Reynolds and Reynolds.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Personal: </b>I have many hobbies and interests, but I mostly enjoy spending time with my wife and 11 month old baby after my work day ends. He is super close to being able to walk and extremely adorable. I also enjoy singing and playing piano, although I wouldn't say that I am terribly proficient in either. I also love going dancing with my wife, so if you know a good baby-sitter let me know! (Just kidding, we've got it covered. Don't flood my inbox/phone please haha...)
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Future Goals: </b>Due to my experience with Reynolds and Reynolds, I have a good grasp of React, REST APIs, and PostgreSQL database querying and management. However, I want to gain even more knowledge in these areas, and expand beyond them. I am also trying to familiarize myself with Python and Java, just so that I can use them when they come in handy.

        <h2>üë©üèΩ‚ÄçüöÄ Projects</h2>

        <p>
          Most of my projects that I have created or played around with are hosted on my <a href="https://github.com/nathanstreger">GitHub account</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>üèÜ Accomplishments</h2>

        <p>
          I received the Rookie of the Year award at Reynolds and Reynolds.
        </p>
        <p>
          I received a Meritorious Performance Award at Reynolds and Reynolds. This was an award given for my exceptional work on a project that allowed our main application (I worked on an application called KeyTrak) to communicate with a mobile device and a QR Code Scanner, and would open up some of the functionality within the app by scanning a QR Code. I was given the award because of several reasons: 
          <ul>
            <li>The complexity of the task for someone so new to programming</li>
            <li>The care and responsibility that I took to make sure that communication flowed smoothly between the Mobile app team and mine.</li>
            <li>Finishing the project before the deadline.</li>
            <li>Quickly fixing issues that were discovered when the project made it to the QA team.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
