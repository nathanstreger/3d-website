# 3d-website
# Simply put, this is my personal 3D website source code. I use netlify to host it for free, so check it out if you ever need to. They offer some cool features.

# Side note for future me: Auto-deploying from netifly by linking the website to this repository does not bundle the images correctly, and the website cannot find them in production.
# However, building the dist folder manually and manually deploying the site on netifly DOES work correctly. I believe this has to do with the minimal setup that 'vite' provides.
# It's likely that a more robust "project creator" package will handle it just fine.
